# Third Party APIs Challenge: Work Day Scheduler


## Description

This project was created for the Week 5 challenge of my coding bootcamp. The goal of this challenge is to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to sace enets for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature a dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist

## Installation
